7. INTERNAL AI JANITOR
The Internal AI Janitor is the product’s assistive intelligence layer — a metadata‑only AI system that helps the user clean their inbox faster, safer, and more intelligently.

It is not a generative model.
It is not a content‑reading model.
It is not an autonomous agent.

It is a pattern‑recognition engine that:

Detects spam patterns

Identifies persistent offenders

Suggests actions

Groups senders

Predicts unsubscribe opportunities

Enhances swipe decisions

Powers insights

Improves automation rules

This page defines the full architecture, behavior, safety rules, and outputs of the AI Janitor.

7.1 Philosophy of the AI Janitor
1. Assistive, not autonomous
AI never takes actions without user approval.

2. Metadata‑only
AI never reads email content.
It uses:

Sender

Domain

Frequency

Headers

Categories

User actions

Historical patterns

3. Safety‑biased
If unsure → AI stays silent.

4. Predictive, not generative
AI predicts what the user likely wants, not what the email contains.

5. Transparent
AI suggestions must be explainable.

7.2 AI Janitor Responsibilities
The AI Janitor performs six core jobs:

Job 1 — Spam Pattern Detection
AI identifies:

High‑frequency senders

Repetitive subject patterns

Known spam domains

Suspicious unsubscribe patterns

Bulk‑sending behavior

Tracking-heavy metadata

“Spray and pray” marketing senders

Outputs:

spam_score

spam_reason

Suggested action: block or delete

Job 2 — Persistent Offender Detection
AI tracks senders that:

Reappear after unsubscribe

Send multiple emails per day

Send from rotating domains

Use deceptive metadata

Trigger user frustration

AI flags them as:

persistent_spammer

domain_rotator

unsubscribe_evader

Suggested actions:

Block sender

Nuke domain

Auto-delete future emails

Job 3 — Suggestion Engine
AI suggests actions for each email:

Delete

Unsubscribe

Block

Keep

Nuke domain

Suggestions are based on:

Sender reputation

User history

Frequency

Domain patterns

Newsletter detection

Past user actions

AI must show:

Confidence score

Reason for suggestion

Example:

“This sender emails you 4× per week and you’ve deleted the last 12 emails. Suggest: Unsubscribe.”

Job 4 — Sender Grouping & Clustering
AI groups senders into clusters:

Newsletters

Promotions

Social updates

Transactional

Personal

Spam

Unknown

Clustering uses:

Domain similarity

Frequency patterns

Header metadata

User actions

Provider categories

This powers:

Insights

Automation rules

Domain nuking

Bulk cleanup suggestions

Job 5 — Inbox Insights Engine
AI generates insights such as:

Top senders

Top spam domains

Most deleted senders

Most unsubscribed senders

Inbox health score

Time saved

Cleanup streaks

Volume trends

Insights must be:

Simple

Visual

Actionable

Example:

“You deleted 87 emails from 9 senders this week. Blocking them would save ~3 minutes/day.”

Job 6 — Automation Rule Suggestions
AI proposes rules such as:

Auto-delete newsletters

Auto-block spammy senders

Auto-nuke domains

Auto-archive promotions

Auto-keep transactional emails

Rules must be:

Suggested only

Never auto‑enabled

Explainable

Undo‑friendly

Example:

“You’ve deleted 100% of emails from @promo-news.com. Suggest: Auto-delete future emails.”

7.3 AI Janitor Architecture
The AI Janitor consists of five sub‑models:

Model 1 — Sender Reputation Model
Inputs:

Sender frequency

Domain reputation

User actions

Provider category

Header metadata

Outputs:

sender_score (0–1)

spam_likelihood

newsletter_likelihood

Model 2 — Pattern Detection Model
Detects:

Repetitive senders

Daily senders

Weekly senders

Batch senders

Rotating domains

Unsubscribe evaders

Outputs:

pattern_type

pattern_confidence

Model 3 — Clustering Model
Groups senders using:

Domain similarity

Header patterns

Frequency

User behavior

Outputs:

cluster_id

cluster_label

Model 4 — Action Prediction Model
Predicts what the user will do:

Delete

Unsubscribe

Block

Keep

Nuke domain

Inputs:

Past actions

Sender reputation

Frequency

Domain patterns

Outputs:

suggested_action

confidence

explanation

Model 5 — Insights Model
Generates:

Inbox health score

Time saved

Cleanup trends

Sender rankings

Domain rankings

Outputs:

insight_cards[]

7.4 Safety Constraints
1. No content reading
Metadata only.

2. No auto‑actions
AI never deletes, blocks, or unsubscribes automatically.

3. No irreversible actions
Undo everywhere.

4. No suggestions for personal senders
Humans are always classified as “KEEP”.

5. No domain nuking suggestions for mixed‑purpose domains
Apple, Google, Amazon, banks, airlines, etc.

6. No suggestions with low confidence
If confidence < 0.6 → AI stays silent.

7.5 AI Janitor Output Object
Code
AIJanitorResult {
  suggested_action: "delete" | "unsubscribe" | "block" | "keep" | "nuke" | null,
  confidence: number,
  reason: string,
  spam_score: number,
  sender_score: number,
  cluster: string,
  insights: InsightCard[],
  automation_suggestions: RuleSuggestion[]
}
7.6 Performance Requirements
Suggestion generation < 150ms

Clustering < 50ms

Insights < 200ms

Pattern detection < 100ms

Undo < 100ms

7.7 Logging
Every AI suggestion logs:

Code
AISuggestionLog {
  id
  user_id
  email_id
  suggested_action
  confidence
  reason
  timestamp
}
Logs power:

AI learning
