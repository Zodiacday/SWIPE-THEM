9.1 Swipe Philosophy
1. One card at a time
No lists. No clutter.
One decision → one swipe.

2. Motion = Emotion
The swipe must feel good.
Tilt, stretch, color, and icon growth create dopamine.

3. Predictable actions
Left = delete
Right = unsubscribe
Up = block
Down = keep
Long‑press = domain nuke

4. Fast by feel
Every swipe must complete in < 120ms.

5. Safe by default
Undo everywhere.

9.2 Card Stack Structure
The UI uses a 3‑card stack:

Card A — Active Card
The card the user is swiping

Full opacity

Full interaction

Card B — Next Card
Slightly scaled down (0.95)

Slightly lowered opacity (0.8)

Slight blur (2px)

Moves up as Card A is swiped

Card C — Buffer Card
Preloaded

Hidden behind Card B

Ensures zero loading delay

Stack Behavior
When Card A is swiped away →

Card B becomes Card A

Card C becomes Card B

New Card becomes Card C

Performance Requirement
Stack update < 16ms (one frame)
